I used React to fly a drone. I probably shouldn’t have. I might have over-reacted.

If this doesn’t work, Cloudspace’s CTO said he’d cancel all the meetups

My ultimate goal with this technology is that it gets acquired by Amazon

because it’s written in JavaScript, it can easily connect to the cloud if you fly it high enough

I tried making it in Angular but all it did was go in an angle… towards the ground

it works on the front-end and back-end, but can’t go side-to-side yet
