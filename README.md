# Let's use React to fly a drone

Let's fly a [Parrot mini-drone rolling spider](http://www.parrot.com/products/rolling-spider/) using React.

## Setup

1. [Buy the drone](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KZM53NC)
2. Clone this repo and run `npm install`
3. Modify the `uuid` field for your drone on [line #5 of this file](https://github.com/sergiocruz/universityjs-react-drone/blob/master/server/drone/index.js#L5).
5. Run `npm start` and you're in business :)
6. A browser window should have opened. Click the `takeoff` button and your drone should start flying.


## The talk

This repo was part of a talk done at a meetup in Orlando called [UniversityJS](http://www.meetup.com/University-JavaScript/events/225262781/) on October 14, 2015. It was their 1-year anniversary so we wanted to do something special.
